## Demo Videos & Adoption Portal Contributions  

I have played a key role in building almost all the pages of [**Seclore Adoption Portal**](https://adoption.seclore.com/), creating structured, easy-to-follow demo content to guide users through product features.  

One of my notable contributions is the **Seclore for Neutral CAD Files** section, which I developed right from planning and structuring the content to creating the demo videos. This section can be accessed here:

Along with this, I have created multiple demo videos across the portal, ensuring that customers get clear, practical, and engaging product walkthroughs.
