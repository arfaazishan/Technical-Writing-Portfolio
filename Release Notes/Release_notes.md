## Seclore Documentation Portal  

I actively contribute to the [Seclore Documentation Portal](https://docs.seclore.com/home/), which serves as the central hub for all customer-facing product knowledge. From user guides to technical references, I ensure the documentation is accurate, structured, and easy to navigate.  

## Release Notes & Release Announcements  

I manage both **Release Notes** and **Release Announcements**, keeping customers updated with the latest product changes:  

- ðŸ“„ [Release Notes](https://docs.seclore.com/home/release-notes) â€“ Provide detailed, technical breakdowns of new features, bug fixes, and improvements for each release. These are designed for admins, developers, and technical users who need in-depth information.  
- ðŸ“¢ [Release Announcements](https://docs.seclore.com/home/release-announcements) â€“ Summarize high-level updates in a customer-friendly format, ensuring business users and decision-makers quickly understand whatâ€™s new without diving into technical details.  

By maintaining both sections, I ensure that **different audiences** (from technical teams to business stakeholders) get the right level of detail they need, exactly when they need it.
